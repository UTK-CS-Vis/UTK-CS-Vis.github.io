# Visualization Critique

Each student will choose a visualization implemented from the list below and do a short presentation on the visualization, describing the pros and cons about the design choices. Each student will also choose a research paper and do a presentation on the research presented in the paper.

Students will have 10-15 minutes at the start of class to do their presentation.

If students want to choose a different visualization, please confirm that it is acceptable with the instructors first.

Date Assigned: 
Due Date:

**Objective**: The objective of this assignment is to give you experience exploring a dataset without using an advanced data visualization system. You will explore a subset of the NOAA National Hurricane Center HURRDAT2 dataset, which lists the track and intensity measurements for historical hurricanes.  For this assignment, you will explore a subset of the HURRDAT2 dataset using Excel (or an equivalent spreadsheet application), discuss your findings, describe your experience, and design at least one low-fidelity prototype (mock-ups) of a data visualization system focused on understanding the HURRDAT2 dataset.

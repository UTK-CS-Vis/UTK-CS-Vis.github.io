# Research Paper Presentation

Each student will choose a research paper to read and present. Presentations are expected to clearly articulate the research contributions of the paper. Students are expected to have slide presentation material that highlights the main themes of the paper and shows any visualizations. Some papers also have accompanying movies or tools that can be shown (but should not take up all of the allotted time).

Students will have 10-15 minutes at the start of class to do their presentation.

Students can either choose a paper from the list below, or choose any paper from [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)](https://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tg/index.html) from the previous five years. (The TVCG journal includes publications from [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/).)

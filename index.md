## {{ site.title }} - {{ site.semester }}

Many disciplines today — from scientific experimentation and simulations to cyber security and financial industry — share a common need to make decisions from complex and voluminous data. Visualization enables people to 'see' data, to reason about the data, and to make new insights.

In this course, we will study the theories that underly visualization techniques, and different techniques and how they apply to different data types. Students will gain hands-on, practical experience building visualizations using the popular [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) JavaScript library.

The course will follow a lecture/seminar style with discussion of assigned readings and lecture topics. A group project will afford students the opportunity to collaborate in building a visualization tool to address a real-world problem.

###  Objectives

The objectives of this course are:

* Learn the key principles of data visualization, including data models, graphical perception, and methods for visual encoding and interaction
* Investigate a variety of techniques and systems in information visualization, including multivariate data, text, and time-oriented data
* Develop skills in building, critiquing, and evaluating visualization techniques
* Build a foundation that will aid the design of new, innovative visualizations
* Apply visualization techniques to real world data analysis scenarios

### Course Prerequisites

Students from a variety of disciplines are invited to take the class, but some prior background in math, computer graphics, and graphical user interfaces will be helpful. Programming experience in JavaScript, though not required, is highly recommended.

### Textbooks

We will be reading recent research papers about the different course topics. We will assign these readings as we progress through the semester.  We will also be using the following book in the course: Interactive Data Visualization, 2nd Edition, by Ward, Grinstein, and Keim, CRC, 2015 (http://www.idvbook.com/).

Also, highly recommended are:

* [Envisioning Information]((https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei)) by Edward Tufte, Graphics Press, 1990.
* [Interactive Data Visualization: An Introduction to Designing with D3]((http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book-2e)), 2nd Edition, by Scott Murray, O’Reilly, 2017.

### Assignments

* Class Participation 5%
* Quizzes on Lectures & Readings 10%
* [Visualization Critique](./assignments/critique.html) 5%
* [Research Paper Presentation](./assignments/paper.html) 10%
* [Assignment 1: Visualization design](./assignments/a1.html) 10%
* [Assignment 2: Visualization tools](./assignments/a2.html) 10%
* [Assignment 3: Visualization implementation](./assignments/a3.html) 10%
* [Group Project](./assignments/project.html) 40%

Your assignments should consist of your own original work.  Building on the work of others (e.g., including 3rd party libraries, public source code examples, and design ideas) is acceptable and in most instances encouraged.  Failure to cite such sources will result in score deductions proportional to the severity of the oversight.

#### Class Participation

Students are expected to attend class, be prepared by doing the readings, and pay attention and participate in discussions.  Doing all three regularly will earn full credit.  Students who miss class are still responsible for the material covered and for any assignments distributed.  If you contact us beforehand with an acceptable reason, you will be excused for the class.

Students must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class.  Therefore, cell phones, watches, pagers, and other such alarms, or personal conversations that disturb the lecture are not allowed.  Students with personal laptops are encouraged to bring them in class.

#### Quizzes

We will have a several quizzes during the semester; they will be given during random class meetings.  Quizzes will generally be worth 10 to 15 points and will cover information from lecture or readings from the current or previous classes.
